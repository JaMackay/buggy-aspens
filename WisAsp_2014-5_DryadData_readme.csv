Experimental design:,,,,,
"The Wisconsin Aspen ""WisAsp"" (Populus tremuloides) common garden was established in 2010 with 328 genets/genotypes. The trees were planted in a completely randomized block design with four replicate blocks and a perimeter of non-experimental trees. The trees were planted with 2.5 x 2.5m spacing and 1m^2 weed mats to reduce weedy growth next to the tree’s stem. The site (Arlington Agricultural Research Station in WI, USA) has a Joy silt loam soil type and was previously used as a grass-alfalfa hayfield. We did not add any soil supplements. To help establish the newly planted trees, they were watered (approximately weekly) in the summer of 2010 and the site was routinely mowed. The garden was enclosed with a 2.4m tall electrified fence to prevent damage by deer.   ",,,,,
Study summary:,,,,,
"In 2014 and 2015, the aspen replicates were surveyed for tree traits (e.g., tree growth/size, bud phenology, leaf morphology, and phytochemistry) and insect communities. The insect communities were visually surveyed in mid-July on days with fine weather (25.6℃±7.1 average maximum temperature, 2.4m/s±1.2 average wind speed, sunny to partly cloudy) and standardized by the time spent surveying the tree canopy (number of insects/species/minute). We recorded every insect observed and all insect-inflicted damage (e.g., vacant leaf rolls and mines). Survey times were interrupted to collect, identify, and record insects. This data set includes all common insects (i.e., species or families that were present on more than 5% of the surveyed trees).  For full details, see: paper citation ",,,,,
